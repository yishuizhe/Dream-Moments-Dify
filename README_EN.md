  üöÄ **My-Dream-Moments** is an emotional companionship program based on LLM (Large Language Model), supporting WeChat for a more realistic emotional interaction experience.

  - **Dify Platform Integration**: Supports Dify as the backend for AI responses, making them more intelligent and controllable. Dify platform: https://cloud.dify.ai/
  - **Bot Activation Optimization**: Fixed an issue where the bot could not be triggered on WeChat desktop when mentioned, and added a feature to trigger the bot by starting a message with its name.
  - **Image Generation Support**: Retains the image generation feature using deepseek-ai/Janus-Pro-7B, requiring API configuration.
  
  ## üé® Future Plans
