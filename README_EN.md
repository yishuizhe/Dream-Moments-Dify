    üöÄ **My-Dream-Moments** is an emotional companionship program based on LLM (Large Language Model), supporting WeChat and providing a more realistic emotional interaction experience.
  
    This project is based on [KouriChat/KouriChat](https://github.com/KouriChat/KouriChat) with the following modifications:
  
    ## ‚ö° Features
  
    - **Dify platform integration**: Supports Dify as the backend for the large language model, making AI responses more intelligent and controllable. Dify platform: https://cloud.dify.ai/
    - **Bot wake-up optimization**: Fixes the issue where the bot could not be triggered on the desktop version of WeChat when @mentioned. Also adds functionality to wake up the bot by starting messages with its name.
    - Extremely rare cases of incomplete responses (fixed).
    - Extremely rare cases where the message processing queue might cause a self-recursive infinite loop (fixed).
  
    ## üé® Future Plans
  
    - After updating to a stable version, there will be no further updates.
  
    ## ‚ú® Features
  
    - **WeChat bot integration**: Enables natural conversations with WeChat friends and group chats.
    - **Multi-turn dialogue support**: Provides more intelligent conversation management for a coherent exchange.
    - **Dify platform support**: Allows switching to Dify as the AI engine, supporting custom prompts and model configurations.
    - **Role-playing mode**: Enables immersive interactions with personalized settings.
  
    ## üì¶ Additional Notes
  
    - Model roles are used in the prompts of the Dify platform.
    - Model parameters such as temperature can be configured on the Dify platform.
    - If the code has not been modified, do not update it automatically.

    ## üìå Installation & Running
  
    ### 1. Prerequisites
  
    1. **Backup mobile phone / Android emulator**
  
       The WeChat desktop login requires a mobile device to be logged in simultaneously, so do not use your primary device.
  
    2. **WeChat secondary account**
  
       You only need an account that can log into the WeChat desktop version.
  
    3. **DeepSeek API Key**
  
       Recommended: [Get API Key (15 RMB free credit)](https://cloud.siliconflow.cn/i/aQXU6eC5)
  
    4. **Dify API Key**
  
       https://cloud.dify.ai/
  
    5. **Modify Dify application's prompt**
  
       Regardless of the model, the following instructions should be included (with two `\` characters customizable for controlling AI response length):
  
       ```
       Note: Each dialogue should be separated by `\`. Use up to two `\`, but it is optional.
       Alternatively, use backslashes `\` to separate sentences or phrases, referring to the output example. The model's output should not include timestamps.
       Note: Use up to two `\` at most.
       Output Example:
       This movie is great, do you like it?\ The core of this question lies in algorithm optimization, which can be analyzed from the perspectives of time complexity and space complexity...\ Are you secretly learning my hobbies?\ Hmm? Are you testing my logic?\ Hmm\ I also need to eat\ Tiramisu tastes good\ But delicious means happiness!\ This problem needs to be solved in three steps~\ You are looking at something weird\ You are saying something strange
       ```
